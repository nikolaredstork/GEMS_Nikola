# GEMS Architecture Breakthrough

GEMS represents a fundamental change from classical **OOME architectures (Object-Oriented Modelling Environment)**, where mathematical models are typically **hard-coded** in the software itself.

This architecture of GEMS aims to export the definition of component models and system configuration from the core software, by relying on **external YAML files**, which enables:

- **Flexible modelling:** Models and system configurations can be defined, extended, or modified directly in configuration files—no changes to the core code are required.
- **Interoperability:** The GEMS file format supports seamless integration with external tools and workflows, such as converting and simulating PyPSA studies using GemsPy.
