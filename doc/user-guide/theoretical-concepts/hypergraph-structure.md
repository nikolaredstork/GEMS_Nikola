# The Hypergraph of a GEMS systEm
## 1 GEMS system = 1 hypergraph

[GEMS](../../index.md) represents a system as a **[hypergraph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergraph)**.  This is precisely the content of a [system](../file-structure/system.md) file.


- [Vertices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_(graph_theory)) correspond to **[components](../file-structure/system.md#components)**, 
- [Hyperedges ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_graph_theory#hyperedge) corresponds to **[connections](../file-structure/system.md#connections)**, which are characterized by **ports**.


This abstraction enables [GEMS](../../index.md) users to represent information exchanges between components. A connection allows a component to share (Linear) Expressions with others.

In this structure, **components** play either an **emitter** or **receiver**
role, while ports remain neutral connection interfaces.

## Emitter and Receiver Roles

A **component** is an instance of a model and represents a system element
(e.g. generator, load, storage, bus).

Depending how [port](../file-structure/library.md#ports) is defined inside the model it refers to, a component can act as:

### Role definition rule

- **Emitter**: If a model defines `port-field-definitions` for a given port, the component acts as an **emitter** for that port. The expression specified in the `definition` field is **emitted** through the port and made available to connected components.

- **Receiver** If a model defines a port **without** any `port-field-definitions`, the component acts as a **receiver** for that port. In this case, the component does not emit any expression and instead **aggregates expressions** emitted by connected components to define its behavior. The receiver uses these aggregated expressions to define one or more `binding-constraints` in its model.

The emitter/receiver role is therefore a **model-level property**, inferred from the model definition, and not an attribute of the port itself.

#### Example of receiver model

In this example, model defines the `port` but does not define any `port-field-definitions`. The component therefore acts as a **receiver**, aggregating all expressions emitted to `balance_port` and using them to construct **balance** constraint.

#### Example of emitter models

In this example, the model defines a `port-field-definition` for `balance_port`. For load model, the expression `-load` is emitted through the port and contributes to connected **receiver** components.

## Example: Kirchhoff’s First Law Constraint

### Hypergraph topology

- One **receiver** vertex : a **bus** component 
- Three **emitter** vertices: generator, load, renewable components.
- All emitters connect to the same `balance_port`

```mermaid

    Bus["bus"]
    Generator["generator"]
    Load["load"]
    Renewable["renewable"]

    Generator --balance_port--> Bus
    Load --balance_port--> Bus
    Renewable --balance_port--> Bus

    style Bus fill:#fff3cd,stroke:#ffc107,stroke-width:3px
    style Generator fill:#d1ecf1,stroke:#0dcaf0,stroke-width:2px
    style Load fill:#d1ecf1,stroke:#0dcaf0,stroke-width:2px
    style Renewable fill:#d1ecf1,stroke:#0dcaf0,stroke-width:2px
```

### System Connections

In [system](../file-structure/system.md) file, users must define connections between emitter and receiver components. In this case connections will be:

```yaml
connections:
  - component1: bus
    component2: load
    port1: balance_port
    port2: balance_port
  - component1: bus
    component2: generator
    port1: balance_port
    port2: balance_port
  - component1: bus
    component2: renewable
    port1: balance_port
    port2: balance_port
```

### Mathematical Equation

Based on connections [GEMS](../../index.md) will create following constraint:

$$
\forall b \in B, \sum_{g \in G_b} P_g - D_b + R_b  = S_b - U_b
$$

Where:

- $B$ — Set of buses, ordered set
- $P_g$ — power generated by the generator  
- $D_b$ — demand at the bus (from load emitters)
- $R_b$ — renewable generation
- $S_b$ — spillage at the bus  
- $U_b$ — unsupplied energy at the bus  

## Summary

[GEMS](../../index.md) represents energy systems as [hypergraphs ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergraph) where components exchange (linear) expressions through ports. Components act as emitters or receivers based on their model definitions, emitters provide expressions, while receivers aggregate them to define system behavior.
